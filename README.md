# Bluetooth-controlled-bot
Here we implement a bluetooth controlled car. It is controlled by using Android mobile phones.So here android phone is used as a transmitting device and Bluetooth module placed in car is used as a receiver. Android phone will transmit command using its in -built bluetooth  to  car so that it can move in the required direction like moving forward,reverse ,turning left,turning right and stop.
